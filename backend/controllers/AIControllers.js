const NOTE_RULES = [
  "Read first: Skim the note to understand context before editing — this avoids accidental deletions.",
  "One idea per heading: Break long notes into headings so each idea is searchable and shareable.",
  "Date & tag consistently: Use a stable date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) and meaningful tags to make sorting and filtering predictable.",
  "Cite sources: Add links or short citations when you paste content from elsewhere to keep notes verifiable.",
  "Avoid secrets: The notebook is not a secure vault — do not store passwords, API keys, or private keys here.",
  "Version notes & autosave: Give important saves descriptive names; autosave is enabled but named snapshots are easier to restore.",
  "Report issues: If content looks broken or missing, use the report/feedback button so we can investigate.",
  "Copyright & privacy: Respect rights and privacy when copying or sharing content.",
];

const CANVAS_RULES = [
  "Purpose: Use the canvas for diagrams, sketches, and annotated images — text-only notes belong in the notebook.",
  "Layers & separate canvases: Use separate canvases or named layers for major iterations so you can revert easily.",
  "Stroke & color: Use moderate stroke widths and high contrast for readability — don't rely only on color to communicate meaning.",
  "Save editable format: Export paths/JSON to preserve editability; export PNG to share images.",
  "Save before destructive actions: Always export or save before clearing or replacing a canvas to avoid data loss.",
  "Collaboration caution: Coordinate saves if multiple people edit the same canvas to avoid overwrites.",
  "Rights & consent: Do not use other people's images or copyrighted material without permission.",
